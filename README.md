# Semantic-Segmentation-PASCAL-VOC
A PyTorch implementation for Semantic Segmentation on PASCAL VOC dataset using R2UNET architecture 

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into a set of pixels representing an object. In this task, the problem of image segmentation and programming pipeline involved in image segmentation has been taken into account.
